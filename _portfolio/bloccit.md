## <a name="bloccit"></a>What is Bloccit?

Originally the thought here was to open with something as exciting as, "Bloccit is a Reddit Clone...", but it soon dawned on me that Bloccit is really nothing of the kind. Bloccit was never meant to be a functional Reddit Clone.  The finished product was never the point.  Thousands of eager Bloc students have dutifully copied (but hopefully not copy/pasted) the code that produces a rather bland, but functional, application.  The app itself is not an expression of those students' vision or skill.  As such, including it in a porfolio of accomplished projects would, without reflection, seem to have dubious value in that it can be construed as blatant resume stuffing.

Here it is: [Bloccit, the Experience](https://arcane-meadow-26733.herokuapp.com/), a project that differentiates itself in no way from thousands of others; a quasi-finished work that I did not conceive of nor author. Its inclusion here is a subterfuge (dare I say a lie?) that is meant to convey that Bloccit is somehow representative of my qualifications to do Rails' related work.  (Note: email: guest@guest.com; password: password; Guest is an admin.)

Yet to frame this accomplishment (for it is indeed a landmark accomplishment for all who complete it), in these terms is to misunderstand the nature of Bloccit.  Bloccit, the site, is not a finished work, but rather a virtual symbol of an intellectual journey.  Each student that has undertaken it has experienced a unique adventure and has presumably learned more (about Rails, about web development, about themselves and their place in the universe) than they could conceive of or articulate. I provided you with a link to the finished product, such as it is, but the entity that lies in wait on the other side of that link does nothing to convey the significance of my initial ride on Rails.

It is that significance that this case study is meant to illuminate.  I do not know that my experience with Bloccit was substantially different than any other student's. However, you, the reader, are presumably here because I have directed you here in the hopes that you would discover...tidbits, for lack of a better word, that would entice you to pay me to write code.  With that strangely specific yet somehow nebulous purpose in mind, my barely unique version of Bloccit is transformed from an anonymous copy of others' work to a hugely relevant learning experience that must be included in a portfolio meant to translate my qualifications to the greater world. The recapitulation of Bloccit was almost certainly the most transformative learning experience of the first half of my Bloc education.  Not to include it would be a disservice to its importance as a gateway to the dev world.  The mirror of this of course is that it would certainly be a mistake to dismiss it because the code was spoonfed to me.  Bloccit is the foundation upon which my Rails' knowledge rests.

The link above will take you to Bloccit and this [link](https://github.com/jeffreydking04/bloccit) will take you to the code that I did not author. Yet how Bloccit made me a ~~better~~ developer is more accurately assessed by meandering through this case study.

## <a name="bottom-line"></a>The Bottom Line

Bloccit is a challenging and extensive introduction to a wide variety of concepts and skills, many of which are listed below.  Although the idea that mastery of all the material presented can be achieved in such a short time frame is laughable, I feel I can nonetheless state with a certain confidence that Bloccit transformed me from a complete novice into a developer that is more than capable of creating, or contributing to, fairly sophisticated Rails' applications.

## <a name="highlights"></a>Highlights

Wonderment.  On so many levels.  That there are people in this world that could combine their intellects and efforts to create such an entity as Rails.  On how many giants' shoulders did Rails itself rest upon?  Sensing the power to get stuff done that Rails represented was akin, for me, to my first forays into calculus or statistics.  This is not to suggest that Rails is anywhere near the achievement that those endeavors are, but the power of the computer is surely in the same category and Rails offered a fresh perspective on that power.  It might take a lifetime to master the art of developing polished, professional applications, but it took a couple of days to learn the skills that empower one to build specialized, dynamic database applications.

Bewilderment, confusion, consternation.  There is a glorious recurring event that I am sure all neophyte devs experince: Inevitably there will come a time when the code simply does not work, when we look to our support group for answers and the reply that is returned is some variation on, "It's in the documentation."  That is a nadir of a moment.  Of course, the average rank beginner has no chance in technical documentation. To borrow a tired phrase, it might as well be written in Klingon.  There simply is not enough context developed in the beginner's conceptualization of the technical landscape.  So what helped me to build that context?  Or, put another way, how did I manage to bootstrap myself into the conversation?

Where to begin?  Below is a relatively long, yet still non-exhaustive list of new skills and concepts that I was introduced to during my sojourn with Bloccit, only one of which (OOP) I had even heard of previous to starting my Bloc program.  The purpose of these case studies is to let the reader know specifically what obstacles each project presented and what new technologies or skills I learned to reach solutions.  In the case of Bloccit, however, everything was brand new.  I was not building on any previous knowledge.  As I intimate above, it was a process of building a completely new framework of knowledge. When building a framework, the best place to start is with the architecture itself.

It was only later, upon reflection, that I came to realize how vital it is, when considering Rails, to understand the MVC architecture, its relationship to the database, and the Active Record ORM that allows Rails and the db to communicate. In practice, I found that when I finally internalized the structure and the relationships, any time the code was not working the way I anticipated, I was able to locate where in the architecture the app was breaking.  This naturally led to constructive research and, ultimately, valid solutions. Understand the architecture and the details snap into place.

Months later, when approaching Angular and its similar structure for the first time, I would recall this lesson learned from Bloccit and it helped me to more efficiently comprehend what I consider to be a far less intuitive syntax.  In the end, code is a linear process.  Because of the way an application's current state moves from file to file, method to method, and expression to expression, solutions to obstacles reveal themselves much more readily if one has a thorough understanding of the architecture of the app.

## <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion

Much of this case study is an attempt to recast the Bloccit project in a new light.  I felt that including a project that I did not author in my portfolio was somehow sketchy, yet not to include it felt entirely wrong, because it was such an instructive experience.  I continue to revisit Bloccit on the regular, because the concepts introduced and the coding techniques contained therein are sufficient to build a variety of applications.  I may not have written the code, but my interaction with it constitutes my genesis as a developer.

## <a name="tl-dr"></a>TL;DR

Bloccit provided a hands-on experience in recapitulating an existing application. It is an extensive introduction to Rails.  Over roughly a two week period, I was introduced to enough new concepts and skills to make the head swim. While I clearly did not master all of the following topics over that time, what Bloccit essentially gave me was an intellectual framework (pun intended), a context if you will, for understanding how the myriad pieces of a Rails' application fit together.

I began my exploration of Bloccit with only a minimal understanding of Ruby and zero knowledge of Rails and its raison.  When I finished Bloccit, I still had a minimal understanding of Ruby, but the confidence that I could build, or contribute to, fairly sophisticated Rails' applications, not because I had internalized all of the lessons, but because I understood the structure and had enough knowledge to do meaningful research that would lead me to the construction of valid code.
